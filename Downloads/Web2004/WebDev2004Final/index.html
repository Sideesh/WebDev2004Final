          <p>I grew up lighting diyas on Diwali, throwing colors on Holi, and hearing stories of Ganesha and Krishna. But when friends asked, "What is Hinduism really about?" — I realized it's not easy to explain.</p>
          <p>This site is my attempt to make it simple, respectful, and approachable. No preaching. Just clarity.</p>

      <h2>Core Concepts of Hinduism</h2>
      <p>These ancient ideas aren’t just philosophy — they’re practical tools for living a meaningful life.</p>
      
      <ul class="concepts">
        <li><strong>Dharma</strong> — Your sacred duty based on your role in life (student, parent, citizen, human). It’s about doing the right thing even when no one is watching. Living in harmony with cosmic order.</li>
        <li><strong>Karma</strong> — The law of cause and effect. Every action (thought, word, deed) creates energy that comes back to you. Not punishment — it’s physics of the soul. You reap what you sow, in this life or the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Moksha</strong> — Ultimate freedom. Breaking free from the cycle of birth and death (samsara) by realizing your true self (Atman) is one with the divine (Brahman). The final goal of human life.</li>
        <li><strong>Yoga</strong> — Not just poses. The complete path to union with the divine through discipline, meditation, devotion, knowledge, or selfless action. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras are the blueprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Ahimsa</strong> — Non-violence in thought, word, and action. The highest ethical principle — practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and the reason many Hindus are vegetarian. Compassion is strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Atman & Brahman</strong> — The eternal soul within you (Atman) is not separate from the ultimate reality (Brahman). “Tat Tvam Asi” — That Thou Art. You are divine. Realizing this = liberation.</li>
        <li><strong>Reincarnation (Punarjanma)</strong> — The soul evolves through many lives, learning lessons until it achieves moksha. Your current life is one chapter in a very long book.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="background:#fff8e6;padding:1.5rem;border-radius:12px;margin-top:2rem;font-style:italic;">
        <p><strong>Most common misunderstanding:</strong> “Hindus worship 33 million gods.”<br>
        Actually — there’s <strong>one ultimate reality (Brahman)</strong> expressed through countless forms. Like different windows showing the same sky. Whether you pray to Shiva, Krishna, Durga, or the formless divine — it’s all paths to the same truth.</p>
